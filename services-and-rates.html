          <h2>Services &amp; Rates</h2>
          <p>
          The Speech Garden is an out-of-network provider. Please call your insurance company to find out if you are eligible for out-of-network speech language therapy and/or evaluation reimbursement. Ask if your insurance company accepts CPT code 92507 and if they require an ICD-9 code (furnished from an evaluation). We do not accept insurance, since we are out-of-network providers. You pay us directly. We provide you with a monthly receipt of paid speech and language therapy services. Then, you submit this to your insurance company for reimbursement. Payment is expected on a weekly basis.

          <p>
          <i>Comprehensive  Evaluations: $300- $550</i><br />
          The use of standardized assessment tools, non-standardized assessment tools, parent and or teacher interview, and clinical observations are used to assess the child’s performance. Evaluations  include a phone consultation to discuss assessment findings. A formal assessment consists of a 90-120 minute session with a Speech Language Pathologist. After  the results have been analyzed, the therapist speaks with caregivers about the child’s strengths and areas of need. Full evaluations are recommended if you are concerned about any of the following: speech sound production, expressive/receptive language, listening skills, pre-literacy, social and play skills, and feeding development.
